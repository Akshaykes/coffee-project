                <p>
                    Certainly! Based on a 2017 review of clinical trials, drinking coffee appears to be safe for most people when consumed in moderate amounts. Moderate coffee consumption is typically defined as 3-4 cups per day, which is equivalent to around 400 milligrams of caffeine.

In fact, research has suggested that moderate coffee intake may be associated with several health benefits, including a reduced risk of several chronic diseases. For example, studies have linked moderate coffee consumption to a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes, heart disease, liver disease, and certain types of cancer.
However, it's worth noting that individual responses to coffee can vary depending on factors such as genetics, age, and overall health. Some people may be more sensitive to the effects of caffeine than others and may experience negative side effects such as jitteriness, anxiety, or disrupted sleep.

        <h1 class="subheading">TYPES</h1>
        <div id="types">
            <p>There are several types of coffee beans, but the two most widely cultivated and commercially available species are Arabica and Robusta. <br>Arabica beans are the most popular type of coffee beans, and they are often considered to produce higher quality coffee. They are grown in higher elevations and cooler temperatures, typically between 1,800 to 6,000 feet above sea level, and they have a more delicate and nuanced flavor profile with notes of fruit, sugar, and acidity. <br>
                Robusta beans, on the other hand, are typically grown at lower altitudes, between 600 to 1,800 feet above sea level, in warmer temperatures. They have a more robust and bitter flavor, with a higher caffeine content than Arabica beans. Robusta beans are often used in espresso blends, as they produce a thick, creamy crema that is highly valued in espresso drinks.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type of bean:</strong> As mentioned in my previous response, there are two primary types of coffee beans: Arabica and Robusta. Other, less common types include Liberica and Excelsa.</li>
                <li><strong> Type of roast:</strong> Coffee beans can be roasted to varying degrees, which affects their flavor profile. Light roast beans are typically roasted for a shorter time and have a lighter color and a more delicate, acidic flavor. Medium roast beans have a more balanced flavor with a slightly darker color, while dark roast beans are roasted for a longer time, resulting in a richer, more intense flavor with a dark brown or black color.</li>
                <li> <strong> Type of grind:</strong> The grind of coffee beans refers to how finely they are ground, which affects the extraction process and ultimately the flavor of the coffee. Coarse grind is typically used for French press or cold brew, medium grind is used for drip coffee makers, and fine grind is used for espresso machines or Turkish coffee.</li>
                <li> <strong>Decaffeinated coffee:</strong> Decaffeinated coffee is made by removing most of the caffeine from the coffee beans using various methods such as solvent extraction, water processing, or carbon dioxide processing. Decaffeinated coffee still contains a small amount of caffeine, typically between 0.1% to 0.3% of the original caffeine content, depending on the method used.</li>
